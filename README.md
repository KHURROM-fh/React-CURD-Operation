As a backend-focused developer, this was my first time using a frontend framework. However, I found it manageable since framework setups are quite similar. While I couldn't fully meet the task conditions due to API adjustments between the backend and frontend, I invested significant time into the project and learned many new things.

One exciting discovery was the Django import-export package, which is simple yet new to me. Additionally, I attempted deployment on Render and PythonAnywhere, but faced challenges and needed more time to resolve them.

Overall, it was a great learning experience as a fresher.
